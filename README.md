# ToDo
This app is my pet-project for consolidation of knowledge about DOM manipulation.
I use drag'n'drop to manipulate tasks, but i didn't adapt it for phones. You can open it on PC to see all the functionality.

## Here is some instructions how to work with it.
1. Open web page: https://semchenock.github.io/ToDo/
2. In the first cloumn you can find sign "+", click it so you can call add form
3. Write here your task and click btn "ok"
4. You can drag your tasks between cloumns, and also organize the order of tasks in the cloumn
5. You can press "trash" button to delite all tasks in cloumn done, you can also drag'n'drop a task to a "trash" button to delete it

### Hope you like it!
